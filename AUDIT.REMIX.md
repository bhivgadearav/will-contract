# Audit Report for MyWill Contract

## Summary
This document outlines the issues and potential vulnerabilities identified in the `MyWill` smart contract. Each section provides an explanation of the problem, its potential impact, and recommendations for mitigation.

### 1. **Block Timestamp**
- **Warning**: Use of `block.timestamp`
- **Explanation**: The `block.timestamp` value can be influenced by miners to a certain extent. This means that miners may potentially alter the `block.timestamp` slightly to change the outcome of a transaction in the mined block.
- **Recommendation**: Avoid relying on `block.timestamp` for critical logic that affects the contract's state or outcome. Consider using a more secure mechanism or re-evaluating logic that depends on time-based decisions.

### 2. **Gas Costs**
- **Warning**: Gas requirement of functions is infinite.
- **Explanation**: The gas requirement for several functions (`MyWill.changeHeir`, `MyWill.iAmAlive`, `MyWill.yearPassed`, `MyWill.deposit`, `MyWill.drain`, `MyWill.getDetails`) is potentially infinite. This indicates that the function could consume more gas than the block gas limit, making it unexecutable on-chain.
- **Recommendation**: Optimize the functions by removing unnecessary loops or minimizing the operations that modify storage. Avoid actions that involve large data structures or copying large arrays in storage.

### 3. **Guard Conditions**
- **Warning**: Use `assert(x)` only for conditions that should never fail.
- **Explanation**: `assert(x)` should be used for conditions that are assumed to be true at all times, apart from potential bugs in the code. For conditions that may fail due to user input or external contract failures, `require(x)` should be used instead.
- **Recommendation**: Review the contract and ensure that `assert` is only used for conditions that should always hold true and use `require` for conditions that can fail based on valid input or other circumstances.

### 4. **Data Truncation**
- **Warning**: Division of integer values yields integer results.
- **Explanation**: Integer division truncates the result to an integer value (e.g., `10 / 100 = 0`). This can lead to unexpected behavior if floating-point precision is required.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that any division operation where a non-integer result is needed uses appropriate data types, such as `uint256`, or explicitly cast to avoid truncation.

### 5. **Compiler Version**
- **Warning**: Compiler version `^0.8.20` does not satisfy the `^0.5.8` semver requirement.
- **Explanation**: There is a discrepancy between the specified compiler version and the version expected by the contract's code.
- **Recommendation**: Align the compiler version to match the expected range or adjust the contract code if necessary.

### 6. **Global Import Restrictions**
- **Warning**: Global import of paths is not allowed.
- **Explanation**: The contract uses global imports for `@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol` and `@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol`.
- **Recommendation**: Specify imports individually or bind all exports of the module into a named import, e.g., `import "path" as Name`.

### 7. **Function Visibility**
- **Warning**: Explicitly mark function visibility.
- **Explanation**: The function visibility is not marked, and in Solidity versions `>=0.7.0`, it is required to explicitly set the visibility of functions.
- **Recommendation**: Review and mark the visibility (`public`, `internal`, `private`, `external`) of all functions in the contract.

### 8. **Error Message Length**
- **Warning**: Error message for `require` is too long.
- **Explanation**: The error messages provided to `require` statements may be too lengthy, potentially impacting readability and understanding.
- **Recommendation**: Shorten error messages for better clarity while maintaining meaningful content.

### 9. **Avoid Time-Based Decisions**
- **Warning**: Avoid making time-based decisions in business logic.
- **Explanation**: Relying on block timestamps for business logic can introduce vulnerabilities if miners adjust timestamps.
- **Recommendation**: Consider alternatives or minimize reliance on timestamps for contract logic where business decisions are made.

**Note**: Ensure that all recommended changes are tested thoroughly in a test environment before deploying to the mainnet.
